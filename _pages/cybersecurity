## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio

### My Mission
In a world driven by data and connectivity, security is not an afterthought—it's the foundation. My mission is to build, protect, and defend the digital systems we rely on. I am passionate about understanding the "how" and "why" of digital threats, from the network level down to the hardware, to implement robust and resilient defenses.

My background in IoT and robotics gives me a unique perspective on security. I am especially focused on the challenges of securing embedded systems and the vast attack surface that comes with a connected physical world.

## Professional Development & Focus

### Current Focus: Ethical Hacking
To formalize my skills and dive deeper into the offensive side of security, **I am currently enrolled in Cisco's Ethical Hacker course.**

This hands-on program is equipping me with a methodical approach to:
* Vulnerability Assessment
* Penetration Testing
* Network Traffic Analysis
* Understanding attacker toolsets and methodologies

This practical training complements my defensive knowledge, allowing me to think like an attacker to build stronger defenses.

## Core Competencies

I am building a comprehensive skill set that covers both the offensive and defensive sides of cybersecurity.

### Core Knowledge & Principles
* **Security Fundamentals:** Deep understanding of the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
* **Network Security:** TCP/IP, OSI Model, firewalls, VPNs, and secure network design.
* **Risk Assessment:** Identifying, assessing, and mitigating vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Software Development:** Integrating security into the development lifecycle.

### Key Skill Areas
* **Network Monitoring & Analysis:** Using tools to monitor for and investigate malicious activity.
* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Scanning and identifying weaknesses in networks and applications.
* **Penetration Testing (Learning):** Actively simulating attacks to test system defenses.
* **IoT & Hardware Security:** A special interest in securing embedded devices, communication protocols (like MQTT), and protecting hardware from tampering.

### Tools & Technologies
* **Network Tools:** Wireshark, Nmap
* **Security Platforms:** Kali Linux, Metasploit (learning), Burp Suite (learning)
* **Operating Systems:** Linux (Ubuntu, Kali), Windows
* **Scripting:** **Python** and **Bash** for automating security tasks and analysis.

## What I'm Learning Next

Beyond my current Cisco course, I am actively diving deeper into:
* **Cloud Security:** Best practices for securing AWS, GCP, and Azure environments.
* **Digital Forensics:** The process of investigating cybercrimes and breaches.
* **Reverse Engineering:** Analyzing malware and firmware to understand its function.
