## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio

### My Mission
In a world driven by data and connectivity, security is not an afterthought—it's the foundation. My mission is to build, protect, and defend the digital systems we rely on. I am passionate about understanding the "how" and "why" of digital threats, from the network level down to the hardware, to implement robust and resilient defenses.

My background in IoT and robotics gives me a unique perspective on security. I am especially focused on the challenges of securing embedded systems and the vast attack surface that comes with a connected physical world.

## Professional Development & Focus

### Current Focus: Ethical Hacking
To formalize my skills and dive deeper into the offensive side of security, **I am currently enrolled in Cisco's Ethical Hacker course.**

This hands-on program is equipping me with a methodical approach to:
* Vulnerability Assessment
* Penetration Testing
* Network Traffic Analysis
* Understanding attacker toolsets and methodologies

This practical training complements my defensive knowledge, allowing me to think like an attacker to build stronger defenses.

## ⚡ Hands-On Experience & Practical Skills

Beyond formal learning, I actively sharpen my skills on real-world simulation platforms and in competitive challenges.

### Hack The Box & TryHackMe
I am an active user on **Hack The Box** and **TryHackMe**, platforms where I constantly test my abilities against vulnerable-by-design machines.

* **Skills Practiced:** Enumeration, vulnerability scanning, service exploitation, privilege escalation (Linux & Windows), web application attacks, and reverse engineering.
* **Profile:** [Link to your TryHackMe Profile]
* **Profile:** [Link to your Hack The Box Profile]

### Capture The Flag (CTF) Competitions
I regularly participate in CTF competitions, which test creative problem-solving and technical skills under pressure. These challenges have sharpened my abilities in areas like:

* **Web Exploitation:** Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and Insecure Direct Object References.
* **Cryptography:** Breaking ciphers and understanding weak encryption implementations.
* **Forensics:** Analyzing network traffic (`.pcap` files), steganography, and file system analysis to find hidden flags.

> **Example Challenge Solved:**
> In a recent competition, I solved a web challenge that involved analyzing a web application's source code. I discovered a blind SQL injection vulnerability in a login form, which I then exploited using manual payloads to bypass authentication and retrieve the flag from the database.
